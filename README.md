## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- JavaScript



### What I learned

Things I learned from this project are:

- Implementing cart logic: open/close, add/delete items, update quantity
- Building interactive image gallery with thumbnail selection and highlighting selected image.
- Creating a lightbox modal with prev/next navigation and synced thumbnails
- Conditionally adding and removing event listeners based on screen width (responsive behavior)
- Adding accessibility features using semantic HTML and ARIA.


### Continued development

Features I wish to add/learn about in the future:

- Implementing focus trap for modals and lightboxes
- Improving overall accessibility
- Exploring CSS transitions and animations for smoother UI interactions



### Useful resources

- [MDN Web Docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/) - Used to review syntax and revisit topics I needed a refresher on.
- [FreeCodeCamp Lesson: Learning Basic OOP by Building a Shopping Cart](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/javascript-algorithms-and-data-structures-v8/learn-basic-oop-by-building-a-shopping-cart/) - Revisited this lesson to refresh my understanding of cart functionality.
- [Aria Authoring Practices Guide](https://www.w3.org/WAI/ARIA/apg/) - To look up the specific aria attributes to use for this project.
